A Frontend TODO list link : https://raftlab-1txb.vercel.app/
A backend URL link: https://raftlab.onrender.com
A Frontend is deployed on the vercel where the Backend of this project is deployed on Render Cloud hosting platform.
In this Projet i have explain a functionality of TODO list , where i have used a CRUD operation on the project.
There is a API request for each feature created in this project and the taskData is stored in the MONGODB database.
I have applied the priority data structure to sort a list of task for the user the earlier date and with a task with a 
higher priority will be at the first and other will be at their position with respect to priority. I have use a Ant Design
UI for the styling and to use the components like button and form areas. I have also used a talwind CSS for the Styling
This project is made for the Task List such as user should set their own task and work along with it to fulfill their goals
too success. Thank You!!
